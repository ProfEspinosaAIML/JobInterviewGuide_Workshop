# ðŸ§ ðŸ“š Job InterviewGuide Workshop

## ðŸŽ¯ Workshop Objectives
This workshop helps students **prepare for a Junior Data Scientist job interview** by combining **machine learning review** with **AI-driven self-assessment**.  
Participants will experience a mock interview guided by a large language model (LLM), complete a technical quiz, and generate a personalized Jupyter Notebook to reinforce their weak areas.

### Core Learning Objectives
- Strengthen understanding of **core ML concepts**: supervised vs. unsupervised learning, regression, classification, KNN, and decision trees.  
- Practice **AI interaction** and **prompt engineering** for professional development.  
- Receive **tailored feedback and exercises** generated from quiz performance.  
- Demonstrate practical **data science competency** through coding exercises.  
- Reflect on learning progress and interview readiness.

## ðŸ§© Workshop Summary
Students will:
1. Copy the course workshop folders and **StudyGuide.txt**.  
2. ZIP the `.ipynb` workshop files into **StudyMaterials.zip**.  
3. Open a new LLM session using a model of their choice.  
4. Upload **StudyGuide.txt** and **StudyMaterials.zip**.  
5. Paste a structured prompt to instruct the LLM to act as an interviewer, quiz them, and create a custom study notebook.  
6. Complete a **15-question interview quiz** (technical + behavioral).  
7. Receive a personalized **JobInterviewGuide_Workshop.ipynb** notebook based on the quiz results.  
8. Push the final graded notebook to GitHub.
